mac_monitor_NetFPGA-10G
=======================

Useful tool to quickly inspect what is being received on a 10G Ethernet interface.

A Chipscope analyser probe monitors the Rx 10GbE MAC port D interface of the NetFPGA-10G board. Inbound packets are captured showing all of its payload and the IFG (Inter-Frame Gap) between them.

Note: interface D on the NetFPGA-10G is also named port 4. It is the farthest from the PCIe fingers.
